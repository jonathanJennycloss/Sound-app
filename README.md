# Sound app
I wrote lines 30-129 and these provide the functionality of pressing each button in the app. 
The code in lines 1-29 and 131-300 was automatically generated by MATLAB app designer. 
My app records and playbacks audio, as well as plots a graph of the recorded data. 
In addition, it stores the previous audio data so that it can be played and plotted. 
The app can apply a fast-Fourier-transform on both sets of data and plot the frequency domain on an axis.
